## [1.5.1] - 2025-10-15

### Fix
- Versioning and MCP Registry publish

Full Changelog: https://github.com/iunera/druid-mcp-server/compare/v1.5.0...v1.5.1


## [1.5.0] - 2025-10-10

### Breaking Change
`Streamable HTTP` is now to be configured by setting `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=http`

### Added
- Added failsafe methods to `SecurityRepository` to prevent modification or deletion of critical "admin" and "druid_system" roles and users, and to disallow password changes for the "druid_system" user, ensuring their immutability.
- Introduced a new feedback tool to gather community input on `druid-mcp-server` usage and prioritize future feature development.
- Implemented anonymous metrics for product enhancement. Opt-out is available via `druid.mcp.metrics.enabled` property.
- Introduced two Spring profiles with dedicated configs: `stdio` (default) via `application-stdio.yaml` and `http` (SSE/HTTP) via `application-http.yaml`.
- Updated to Spring AI 1.1.0-M3.

### Changed
- Set `stdio` as the default Spring profile (non-web, STDIO transport).

## [1.4.0] - 2025-10-02

### Added
- Introduced basic-security components to support Apache Druid basic authentication and authorization modification via MCP
- Added support for toggling server Druid Basic Security Tools on/off with `DRUID_EXTENSION_DRUID_BASIC_SECURITY_ENABLED`
- Expanded test coverage for basic-security flows and readonly interactions.
- Prepared CI/CD release workflows and documentation updates for the 1.4.0 release.

### Notes
- This release adds foundational basic-security tooling and read-only controls; deployments should verify environment variables (DRUID_ROUTER_URL, DRUID_AUTH_USERNAME/DRUID_AUTH_PASSWORD) and enable security features as required.
- DRUID_COORDINATOR_URL needs to be configured to use the Druid Basic Security Tools
